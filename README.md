# Evaluates-Performance-of-CNN-with-Adam-and-RMSProp
This is my research thesis to complete my education as Master of Computer Science. The motivation of this study is to search best learning rate to achieve highest accuracy/recall in wildlife animal classification while using CNN. Dataset were taken from SnapShot Serengeti (http://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-serengeti) with imbalance condition. Totally I just took 11 classes. I applied combination of 3 state of the art CNNs (AlexNet, Resnet 50, Densenet 121), 2 optimizer (Adam and RMSProp) and 6 learning rates. 
I put 6 files which names are related to CNN model and optimizer used. Basically all of them are same. The difference are only model name, optimizer and learning rate value. The codes were coming from combination of some open source codes. I wrote using PyTorch framework. I present those to anyone whereas perhaps my study or codes could create an idea or insight within their projects.  
This study also has been proposed to one Scopus-index journal and the status is still under reviewed. Hopefully it could be published soonest.
